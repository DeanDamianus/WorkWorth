Work Worth
Under Developing Application that helps users calculate how much work it takes to afford the things they want.

Work Worth is a smart and mindful financial app designed to help users understand the true effort behind every purchase. By entering their monthly salary, total working hours per month, and the price of a desired item, users can instantly see how many hours of work they need to afford it.

Beyond calculation, Work Worth introduces a unique reflection reminder feature — a gentle notification that appears after a set period (for example, one hour). This reminder encourages users to think again about whether they truly need the item or if the desire was momentary.

Main Features (planned):

Input monthly salary, total work hours, and desired item price

Calculate how many hours of work are needed to buy the item

Reflection reminder after a customizable time (e.g., 1 hour)

Clean, minimal, and user-friendly interface

Helps build awareness of spending habits and financial priorities

Currently under development, Work Worth aims to promote mindful spending, combining financial insight with psychological reflection — helping people connect effort, money, and meaningful choices.
